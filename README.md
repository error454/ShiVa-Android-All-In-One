ShiVa-Android-All-In-One
========================
An Android project for the ShiVa game engine that aims on integrating various SDKs.  As of this moment, nothing has been integrated.

What's Missing
--------------
The obj/* folder is not included.  This is what contains the S3DClient which is specific to the processor you've chosen along with a couple other smaller libraries.  I'd recommend that you export an Android project with the processor settings you want and grab the obj folder from there.

Note on original code
---------------------
The code that this project is based on was written by Stonetrip and was produced by their Unified Authoring Tool.  The libraries included in this project are also created by Stonetrip.
